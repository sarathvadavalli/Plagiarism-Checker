# Plagiarism-Checker
I completed this project as my 3rd task in Code Clause internship. (Python development)

Overview:

Plagiarism checker is a useful tool for detecting plagiarism or similarity among two documents. This project uses 'tkinter' library to create a user-friendly interface.

It also uses 2 modules to build the project:
1) 'filedialog' to access the files from our system.
2) 'SequenceMatcher' to compare the contents of files and calculate percentage of plagiarism in them.
